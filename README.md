# Cat-and-Dog-SVM
The Cat or Dog Classifier is a machine learning project that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to identify whether an uploaded image contains a cat or a dog. The model is trained on labeled image datasets and can predict the class of new images with high accuracy.
This project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in computer vision, particularly in image classification.
